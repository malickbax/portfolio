# Description
- This is the first iteration of a web application to showcase my portfolio. Languages used are HTML and CSS. While I recognise this is a first version, please take note of the points mentioned below. Next version (v 2.0) of the portfolio website will include the following updates: 
- Responsiveness of pages when viewed on different devices and screen sizes 
- A better use of horizontal space. I recognise that items are vertically stacked on top of each other
- Resume to be updated with web development-relevant items and be added to website
