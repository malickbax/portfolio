# Portfolio Website

## Description
Code for professional portfolio website. Please visit deployed URL for final product. I used Vue.js to build my professional portfolio due to its incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework. Due to its progressive features, Vue.js can consistently get into the code database without the need to rewrite the entire item. It is possible to work on all the components one after another and make the code more flexible.
